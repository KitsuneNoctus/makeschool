# FEW-2-5-Titanic-Visualization

The starter code here creates a simple visualization of the Titanic dataset. 

## Getting started

You'll need to run this with a local server. You can use Live Server with VS Code. 

The goal of this assignment is display the Titanic data. In the previous assignment you examined the data and processed it for useful information. Here the goal is make that information visible. 

## Learning Objectives

- Create HTML element with JS
- Style HTML element with JS
- Use array methods to control the display of elements

## Submission

Submit your work on [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/218919)

## What to make? 

Your project should be a web pages that displays the information graphically. Get creative, don't worry about what it looks like. 

Your page should try and answer as many of these questions as possible. You can get creative. The images can be abstract. Have fun with the numbers!

Try and display as much of the data from the Titanic dataset listed below as you can. Think about how you might display these things using CSS.

- How many passengers? 
- How many survived? 
- How many died? 
- How many men? 
- Hoe many wonmen?
- Where did each passenger embark? 
- what class did each passenger travel? 
- How much did each passenger pay? 
- Did more men or women survive?
- Did passenger class affect survival?

Stretch challenges! Try these challenges if you've completed the challenges above. 

- What was the most common fare paid? 
- What were the ages of the passengers? 
- How many passengers embarked at each of the three stops? 

Use these CSS properties to express the ideas above: 

- background color
- opacity
- width, height
- border radius
- border width, color, and style

## What might it look like?

## Evaluating your work

| Aspect | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------|:--------------|:------|:--------|
| **Completion** | Displays less than 7 of the data points listed above | Displays 7 or more of the dat points | Displays all 10 of the data points |
| **Code style** | Does not follow coding best practice, the style inconsistent | Code is consistently styled, variables are well named and self documenting, follows coding best practice as confirmed by the linter | Code reviewed by peer |
